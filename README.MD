## steps
`export PYTHONPATH=/home/users/t/tilo-himmelsbach/SPEECH/speech-transformer-pytorch_lightning`  
on hpc: `module load comp`
1. build manifests `python scripts/prepare_data/extract_datas/librispeech.py`
2. build sentencepiece vocab `python scripts/prepare_data/build_vocab.py`
3. train model `python main_trans_eng.py`

## end2end chinese-english code-swiching speech recognition in pytorch

This is a mixed project borrowing from many other open projects 
opened recently, trying to use most technique and tricks. And with 
pytorch_lightning, experiments can be carried out in an easy way. 
I will try to code in a clean style, with well named functions and 
class and designed file tree, for new guys to understand easily.
And i will try to make evey calculation in a batched and cleaned way.
(such as add bos & eos into batched target and spec augment)
Any ideas can be put into the issues, and welcome for discussion. 
(This project is still being building and reorganizing)

highlights:
    
    can use multiple chinese datasets, with scripts processing those different dataset into a single style
    use sentencepiece encoding for the extension of code-switching
    use tfrecord for fast dataloading (to be add)
    a batched specaugment layer, can be use as a layer like dropout
    use speed perturb in one line
    use low frame rate
    joint training with ctc & cross entropy (label smoothing)
    lookahead & radam
    fast decoding (TODO)
    dockerfile for quick environment install (to be add)
    batched beam decode with length penalty
    
datasets:
    
    aishell1 170h
    aishell2 1000h
    prime 100h
